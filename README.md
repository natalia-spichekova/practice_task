# Sentiment analysis on Large Movie Review Dataset 

## Project description 
The goal of the project is to create and analyze models for sentiment analysis created for Large Movie Review Dataset. 

Decsription of models and their evaluation is available at *Sent_analysis_report.ipynb* file. 

The trained models files have too large size to be uploaded to the github repository. 
The trained models can be accessed from Google Drive by the following links:
